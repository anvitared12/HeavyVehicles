🚀 EngineEx
EngineEx is a smart diagnostic interface that helps users input engine-related parameters, check for issues, and receive intelligent suggestions or possible faults in real-time.
🧩 Problem Statement
Modern engines are complex, and identifying faults manually often requires deep technical knowledge or costly diagnostic tools. Many vehicle owners and technicians struggle with:
Understanding engine parameters and symptoms

Quickly diagnosing common engine problems

Making informed decisions without expert help

This gap delays repairs, increases costs, and often results in poor engine health due to misdiagnosis or neglect.

❗ Why This Problem Exists
Lack of Accessible Tools: Diagnostic tools are often expensive, proprietary, or require training.
Fragmented Information: Data about engine symptoms and possible faults is scattered across forums, manuals, and mechanics' knowledge.

Limited Predictive Insight: Users rely on reactive checks rather than predictive analytics to maintain engine health.

No Simple UI: Most solutions lack a user-friendly interface for non-experts to input symptoms and understand outcomes.

✅ Our Solution
EngineEx addresses these issues through an integrated web interface powered by the MERN stack and intelligent backend logic:
🛠️ Features
